DeathRun 2.2 Mod for IW4x
=========================
Deathrun is a mod in which a single player fights alone against the other team, his only weapons are his deadly traps. <br>
The players on the opposite team have to kill the trapmaster (aka. activator) after finishing his course without dying. <br>

<hr>

This mod works with [IW4x](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw4x-client), you may do as you please with the code. <br>

Configuration & Installation
===========================
Prenotes: Whereas "IW4x Root" you should be aware it is the root directory of iw4x installation, also please see "Requirements" section. <br>

1. [Compile and use the latest iw4x.dll](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw4x-client) <br>
2. Clone deathrun_developer to "IW4x Root/mods" <br>

5. Run makeMod.bat to build mod.ff <br>
6. Run makeIWD.bat to build .iwd files <br>

Adding new stuff
